# Usage

First, create a "tracks.txt" file in the same directory as the exe file or python file.

It should look something like this

Then simply paste any tracks you want in the cuplayout in tracks.txt, line by line.
They don't have to be capitalized, but they must be spelt correctly with correct grammar (apostrophes etc)
All the tracks will be alphabetized in the cuplayout too.

Here is an example of a tracks.txt file:

Once you are done, simply run the executable/python file, and it should produce a "cuplayout.cup" file in the directory!

Now copy this file to the "ctgpr" folder on your sd card, replace the file if you need. And boot up ctgp!

If you dont have the correct amount of tracks to fit a cup (example 18 tracks) it will duplicate the last track however many times needed to fill the next cup.
